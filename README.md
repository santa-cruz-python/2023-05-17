# Santa Cruz Python Meetup - May 17th 2023

We'll go over ways to take advantage of state of the art deep learning models in Python, using HuggingFace models

HuggingFace is like GitHub for data science models; it allows searching and cloning model and dataset repos.

The `transformer` library from HuggingFace implements Transformer type models and much more, and it wraps a client to the multitude 
of repositories available on HuggingFace's site. It takes care of downloading 
model weights and keeping them up to date in your environment.

The Jupyter notebooks here show various applications in NLP, Visual Document Question Answering, and Image Generation and transfer.
